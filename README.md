First temptative of web scrapping. The script scrap data from ABIHAL's site.
The data is about brazilians hotels, especificatly in the state of Alagoas. Information about localization, name and classification are present in the output.
Every time the code was run, the site will be accessed and the data colected, and this is independent of the numbers of hotels in a row. The script may fail if the
site's archteture is changed.
